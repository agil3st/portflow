## Welcome to Portflow

**Portflow** is Portfolio web template build with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and simple step to start. This project only contains basic files such as **.html**, **.css**, and **.js**. By using TailwindCSS CDN way, this project is [not intended to run in production](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn). For now, **Portflow** only provide page layouts for simple Article or Blog UI like [Medium](https://medium.com/). Any future development update will be announced on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agil3st/) profile.
